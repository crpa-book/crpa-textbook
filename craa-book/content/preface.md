# Preface
When I started programming when I was 11 using VisualBasic.NET reading and going through the years with C#, C and C++ doing my hobby projects and started get fond of programming and curious about how specific products are made like browsers, operating systems and others but one of the applications I was always curious about was **Compilers**. These applications must be a magical creations created by those programming wizards, that's what I thought of them.  
In my first year at college I decided to learn compilers construction. Did my searches, started to get into the glorious Dragon Book[1] barely understood the first chapter, although the book wasn't that impossible but it was more like a textbook that needs a professor or someone to help me to get through it, So after reading the highly-recommended Crafting Interpreters[2] I had an overview and was able to get more deeply in the topic and reading more books and doing more compilers and interpreters in my free time as hobby.  
After writing my notes, I decided to write my own little book to be as a help for undergraduates and any one who is interested to learn the topic in a more straightforward way.
